# CubeSat-Radio-v0.1
KiCad project of the cubesat radio test article in preparation for the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge

This repository uses the SFU Satellite Team's KiCad component library as a submodule.
To start working on the repository use:

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/SFUSatClub/CubeSat-Radio-v0.1.git```

If you modify either the component schematic or footprint libraries you must push those changes to the SFUSatClub/KiCad-Lib repository.

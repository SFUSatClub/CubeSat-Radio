# CubeSat-Radio
KiCad project of the cubesat radio test article in preparation for the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge

This repository uses the SFU Satellite Team's KiCad component library as a submodule.
To start working on the repository:

```
1. Open the git shell
2. Navigate to the directory you wish to place the repository inside
3. git clone --recursive "https://github.com/SFUSatClub/CubeSat-Radio.git"
4. cd .\CubeSat-Radio\KiCad-Lib\
5. git checkout master
```

If you modify either the component schematic or footprint libraries you must push those changes to the SFUSatClub/KiCad-Lib repository.
